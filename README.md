# Majsteroids!

An oldschool asteroids clone. Most assets are original, animated asteroid and explosion are modified from a public domain version.

Version 1.0 is mostly playable. 

_Warning: you'll need .net framework 4.5 in order to launch_

### Problems that I'll never get to fixing:
- centerpoints objects are not in the center of objects
- a tiny memory leak
- locked framerate of 60 fps

### What to do with it
play it if you have the time and want to play it
